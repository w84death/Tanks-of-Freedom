TIP_HEADER,"Did you know that..."
TIP_1,"Each unit can attack only once a turn"
TIP_2,"Units have weaknesses and advantages - only troops can capture buildings but they have almost no chance against tanks and tanks can’t attack helis"
TIP_3,"You can deploy soldiers in HQ but it is cheaper to do so in the barracks"
TIP_4,"A unit loses all its remaining AP for the turn when capturing a Tower"
TIP_5,"All production buildings require a soldier to maintain it - capturing them will cost you a soldier unit"
TIP_6,"HQ and captured Towers or Airports will produce cash in every turn"
TIP_7,"Cash can be spent for deploying units and movement"
TIP_8,"Use your cash wisely - a big army will be slower and less effective than a small squad"
TIP_9,"It’s never a good idea to send a unit onto the battlefield alone"
TIP_10,"Mixing unit types in squads gives you a strategic advantage"
TIP_11,"You cannot deploy a unit when the spawning point is blocked and neither can the enemy - block enemy factories with your units"
TIP_12,"Units can attack only adjacent tiles - so when your target is far away you should first move your unit closer"
TIP_13,"HQ is the most valuable building in game - if you capture the enemy HQ you will win the game"
